# Things that i learned
1. using localStorage i think is the best feature that i learned with this project, because of the ability to store your data in local device even if you reload or close the window, although its only valid in pc not in mobile, i think that is enough for the moment
2. using a library, even though i only use one library at the moment that is date-fns, its really open my vision for future projects, because of what library can provide you. the library will make it easier to us and will take less time to build than using only vanilla JS or making the method alone
3. OOP, object oriented programming and the SOLID principles really help me through with making the code easier to navigate and bug fix the code
